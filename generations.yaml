    description: "The original BMW X3 pioneered the compact luxury SUV segment, based on a modified 3 Series platform. It featured permanent all-wheel drive (xDrive) and was positioned as a more agile, road-focused alternative to larger SUVs. Engine options included four and six-cylinder petrol and diesel units. While initially criticized for firm ride quality and some interior material choices, later models addressed these issues through updates. The first-generation X3 helped establish the premium compact SUV category that would later become one of the most competitive segments in the automotive market."

Engine options expanded to include more efficient turbocharged four and six-cylinder units.
